  <p>Python is a popular programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum, and released in 1991.
It is used for web development (server-side),software development,mathematics,system scripting.
</p>
<p>Python was designed for readability, and has some similarities to the English language with influence from mathematics.Python uses new lines to complete a command, as opposed to other programming languages which often use semicolons or parentheses.To know where to practice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can download the most recent major version of Python which is Python 3, which we shall be using in this tutorial. However, Python 2, although not being updated with anything other than security updates, is still quite popular.</li>
  <li>In this tutorial Python will be written in a text editor. It is possible to write Python in an Integrated Development Environment, such as Thonny, Pycharm, Netbeans or Eclipse which are particularly useful when managing larger collections of Python files.</li>
  <li>Or you can use any online Python compiler to practice.</li>
</ul>

        <header>Why Python?</header>
<article>
  <p>Compared to other languages,</p>
<ul>
  <li>Python works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).</li>
<li>Python has a simple syntax similar to the English language.</li>
<li>Python has syntax that allows developers to write programs with fewer lines than some other programming languages.</li>
<li>Python runs on an interpreter system, meaning that code can be executed as soon as it is written. This means that prototyping can be very quick.</li>
<li>Python can be treated in a procedural way, an object-oriented way or a functional way.</li>
</ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="Hello_world">
        <header>Hello World</header>
<article>
Our first step in python,is to print "Hello world"
<code>>>> print("Hello, World!")
Hello, World!"</code>
</article>
        </section>
<section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
<article>
  <p>Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
  <p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
  <p>Example(Try it yourself),</p>
<code>x = 5
y = "John"
print(x)
print(y)</code>
<p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set.</p>
</article>
        </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
        <header>Data types</header>
<article>
  <p>In programming, data type is an important concept.</p>
<p>Variables can store data of different types, and different types can do different things.</p>
  <p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
<p>
<p>Python has the following data types built-in by default, in these categories:</p>
  <ul>
<li>Text Type: <span class="glow">str</span></li>
<li>Numeric Types: <span class="glow">int, float, complex</span></li>
<li>Sequence Types:	<span class="glow">list, tuple, range</span></li>
<li>Mapping Type:	<span class="glow">dict</span></li>
<li>Set Types:	<span class="glow">set, frozenset</span></li>
<li>Boolean Type:	<span class="glow">bool</span></li>
<li>Binary Types:	<span class="glow">bytes, bytearray, memoryview</span></li>
<li>None Type:	<span class="glow">NoneType</span></li></ul>

  <section class="main-section" id="Getting_input">
        <header>Getting input</header>
<article>
  <p>Python allows for user input.That means we are able to ask the user for input.</p>
  <p>Python 3.6 uses the <span class="glow">input()</span> method.</p>
  <p>The following example asks for the username, and when you entered the username, it gets printed on the screen:</p>
<code>username = input("Enter username:")
print("Username is: " + username)</code>
</article>
        </section>
<section class="main-section" id="Comments">
        <header>Comments</header>
<article>
  <p>Comments can be used to explain Python code.Comments can be used to make the code more readable.</p>
  <p>Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.</p>
  <p>Comments starts with a <span class="glow">#</span>, and Python will ignore them:</p>
<code><span class="comment">#This is a comment</span>
print("Hello, World!")<span class="comment">
"""
This is a comment
written in
more than just one line
"""
</span>
</code>
<p>Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.
To add a multiline comment you could insert a <span class="glow">#</span> for each line or not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.</p>
</article>
        </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="If...else_statement">
        <header>If...else statement</header>
<article>
  <p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Equals: <span class="glow">a == b</span></li>
<li>Not Equals: <span class="glow">a != b</span></li>
<li>SLess than: <span class="glow">a < b</span></li>
<li>Less than or equal to: <span class="glow">a <= b</span></li>
<li>Greater than: <span class="glow">a > b</span></li>
<li>Greater than or equal to: <span class="glow">a >= b</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.</p>
  <p>An "if statement" is written by using the <span class="glow">if</span> keyword.</p>
<code><pre>a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")</pre></code>
<p>In this example we use two variables, a and b, which are used as part of the if statement to test whether b is greater than a. As a is 33, and b is 200, we know that 200 is greater than 33, and so we print to screen that "b is greater than a".</p>
<p>The <span class="glow">elif</span> keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".</p>
<code><pre>a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")</pre></code>
</p>The <span class="glow">else</span> keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.</p>
</article>
        </section>
   <section class="main-section" id="Strings">
        <header>Strings</header>
<article>
  <p>Strings in python are surrounded by either single quotation marks, or double quotation marks.</p>
  <p>'hello' is the same as "hello".</p>
  <p>You can display a string literal with the <span class="glow">print()</span> function:</p><code>print("Hello")</code>
<p>Assigning a string to a variable is done with the variable name followed by an equal sign and the string:</p>
<code>a = "Hello"
print(a)
</code>
</article>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
        <header>Lists</header>
<article>
  <p>Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.</p>
  <p>Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.</p>
  <p>Lists are created using square brackets:</p><code>thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)</code>
<p>List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.</p>
<p>When we say that lists are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.If you add new items to a list, the new items will be placed at the end of the list.A list can contain different data types:</p>
<code>list1 = ["abc", 34, True, 40, "male"]
</code>
<p>The list is changeable, meaning that we can change, add, and remove items in a list after it has been created.</p>

  <section class="main-section" id="For_loops">
        <header>For loops</header>
<article>
  <p>A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence (that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).</p>
  <p>This is less like the <span class="glow">for</span> keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.</p>
  <p>With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.</p><code><pre>fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)</pre></code>
<p>The for loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.</p>
</article>
        </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="While_loops">
        <header>While loops</header>
<article>
  <p>With the while loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true.</p>
  <p>Print <span class="glow">i</span> as long as <span class="glow">i</span> is less than 6:</p>
<code><pre>i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  i += 1</pre></code>
<p>The while loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing variable, i, which we set to 1.</p>
<p>With the break statement we can stop the loop even if the while condition is true:</p><code><pre>i = 1
while i < 6:
  print(i)
  if i == 3:
    break
  i += 1</pre></code>
</article>
        </section>
  <section class="main-section" id="Functions">
        <header>Functions</header>
<article>
  <p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.</p>
  <p>You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.A function can return data as a result.</p>
  <p>In Python a function is defined using the <span class="glow">def</span> keyword:</p>
<code><pre>def my_function():
  print("Hello from a function")
my_function()</pre></code>
<p>From a function's perspective:</p>
<p>A parameter is the variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition.</p>
<p>An argument is the value that is sent to the function when it is called</p>
<p>The following example has a function with one argument (fname). When the function is called, we pass along a first name, which is used inside the function to print the full name</p><code><pre>def my_function(fname):
  print(fname + " Refsnes")

my_function("Emil")
my_function("Tobias")</pre></code>
<p>To let a function return a value, use the <span class="glow">return</span> statement:</p><code><pre>def my_function(x):
  return 5 * x

print(my_function(3))
print(my_function(5))</pre></code>
